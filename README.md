### Important files

**Part1_Env_AC.ipynb** Explanation of gym environments used and our Actor Critic main file. Used mostly for comparison to SAC. Can be skipped over if not interested. Requires *train.py*, *buffer.py*, *utils.py*, and *model.py* to run.

**Part2_SAC.ipynb** Implementation of Soft Actor Critic by Tuomas Haarnoja. Papers are under the folder *papers*. Does not require anything else.

# Disclaimer
All Jupyter notebooks run best on Google Colab. We do not guarantee they run as smoothly elsewhere.
